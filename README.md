Greedy Respiration Optimization Algorithm for Multi-objective Problems
Discover our newly published research on a novel nature-inspired optimization technique â€” the Greedy Respiration Optimization Algorithm (GROA). Inspired by the dynamic mechanism of breathing, GROA introduces a unique balance between exploration and exploitation through adaptive pressure modeling. The algorithm has shown strong performance across benchmark functions and real-world multi-objective problems.
